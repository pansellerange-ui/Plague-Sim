# Simple Plague Simulation (C#)

This is a beginner-friendly project that simulates the spread of a plague based on:

- Region  
- Year  
- Population  
- Starting infected  

The model is intentionally simple so a high school student can understand it.

## How It Works

The simulation runs for 60 days and updates:

- **Susceptible**
- **Infected**
- **Recovered**

Each day:

Rates automatically change based on year and region.

## How to Run

1. Paste this Replit link into your browser: https://replit.com/@pansellerange/Plague-Sim-1?v=1
2. Go to console
3. Hit run


Then enter:

- Region  
- Year  
- Population  
- Starting infected  

You’ll see the plague spread day by day.

## Why This Project Exists

This is a simplified epidemic model meant for learning:
- C# basics  
- Variables & loops  
- User input  
- Basic simulation design  
- GitHub project structure
